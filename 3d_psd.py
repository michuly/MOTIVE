# get files - how big and long is one depth?
# get 3d fft from Oceanography, and realize where is 3d psd
# write u_tf, v_tf; calculate energy spectrum; calculate radial profile;
# transfer data to local computer? plot

# How about chunks of fft?
# connect the project to github? if its more than 1-2scripts
